When you start the program, it begins by prompting you to enter a green letter. In this above example, there are no green letters, so you would press enter, as it instructs.

Next, the program prompts for yellow letters. In this case, there are 3-- we will start with 'r'. Now the program prompts the user for the position. Since the 'r' is in the 2nd position out of 5, we enter '2.'
