## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Using the program

When playing Wordle, start by entering your own first guess into the game. 


When you start the program, it begins by prompting you to enter a green letter. In this above example, there are no green letters, so you would press enter, as it instructs.
